# ðŸ’¶ C++ ATM Simulator

A console-based ATM simulation in **C++**, built as part of a university assignment.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, exception handling, STL containers (`vector`, `tuple`), and basic command-line interaction.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- âœ… Load banknotes into ATM boxes with different denominations (10, 20, 50, 100 EUR)
- âœ… Withdraw up to 3000 EUR using available denominations
- âœ… View current ATM box status and total cash
- âœ… Uses C++ classes, no traditional C-style arrays or standalone functions
- âœ… Exception handling for invalid inputs and edge cases

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

- `Box` class: represents an individual banknote box
- `ATM` class: manages all ATM logic and user commands
- `main()`: entry point that reads commands and delegates execution
